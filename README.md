# Restoration of old gramophone recordings
 
There are described algorithms for eliminating white noise, impulsive disturbances, and scratches from preserved vinyl recordings. Additionally, the situation where there are many copies of a recording with uncorrelated noise components is taken into account. Based on the discovery that scratches are essentially the playback mechanism's impulse response, the scratch removal technique was developed. Therefore, it is anticipated that different scratch pulses will exhibit similar properties for a certain playback device. A matching filter-detector, a linear adaptive noise subtracter, and an interpolator for the replacement of permanently distorted samples make up the scratch removal system. The noise-pulse detection-signal interpolation method forms the foundation of the impulsive noise removal system.
